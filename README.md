# DH 150 Assignment 6 - Low Fidenlity Prototype

Purpose: 
[1] to begin working through how exactly the user will interact with the application
[2] to learn how to use low-fidelity prototyping in the earrly stages of design

## Project Description
The current project will try to ease the discomfort of user's in their effort of daily cooking. During this unpleasant time, a handy and easy-to-use app will eliminate the pain in the user's task to think and look for an unique and balanced food recipe, and do a grocery shopping for those ingredients.

- These functions will allow a user to easliy look receive inspiration for their cooking. It will provide conveninece and security by shortening their grocery shopping process. Therefore, will make cooking more fun and desirable!

The purpose of this fidelity test is to test the user interface with the prototype. The flow of the user's naviagtion along the app will test the accessibility of the app.


## Tasks
low-fidelity will be followed by the following tasks: 
[1] look for naviagation button
[2] look for recipes that they want
[3] check the nutrition detaills and recipes
[4] look for the list of options for nearby grocery stroes
