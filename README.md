# DH 150 Assignment 6 - Low Fidenlity Prototype

### Purpose:
- to begin working through how exactly the user will interact with the application.
- to learn how to use low-fidelity prototyping in the earrly stages of design.

## Project Description
The current project will try to ease the discomfort of user's in their effort of daily cooking. During this unpleasant time, a handy and easy-to-use app will eliminate the pain in the user's task to think and look for an unique and balanced food recipe, and do a grocery shopping for those ingredients. Followings are the touchpoints of where the impovement and development should be focused on:

- easy way to look for particular food recipe
- calorie, ingredient list
- pick up or delivery option for those ingredients

: These functions will allow a user to easliy look receive inspiration for their cooking. It will provide conveninece and security by shortening their grocery shopping process. Therefore, will make cooking more fun and desirable!

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to test the user interface with the prototype. The flow of the user's naviagtion along the app will test the usability and the level of utilization of the app.


## Tasks
#### low-fidelity will be followed by the following tasks: 
#### [1] look for recipes that they want
#### [2] look for the list of options for nearby grocery stroes
#### [3] try to check out the shopping cart

## Notes on Wireflow Test
### Task 1
From the task, I realized that it actually took about 5 min. for the users to search their recipes. I noticed that users were likely to use the modifier function after they picked the categories with several of attempts of search. I noticed that they had a little difficulity in recognizing the function icons in the modifier, because there was a short pause after they saw the buttoms. By this, it might be better to word the icons out rather than using the drawing icons. After few minutes, the users seem to be able to pick out the food that they liked.
### Task 2
Compared to the first task, I was able to see that the users seem to follow the path that the app has created for them. Most of the test went very smoothly on this process. They were able to locate all the listings of the grocery stores near by after clicking on to the pick-up or delivery option. They were able to successfully compare the distance and etimated time of arrival for the ingredients and make decisions accordingly. 
### Task 3
During this process, I was able to see that the users were successully go to the check out page of the app. After they pick the delivery button, the function at the buttom of the review page with "Check out" helped their way out to purchasing process. I did not catch any difficulites of the uses in this process. 

## Summay
By this task, I was able to learn about the flow and how the easy navigation thrrough the app helped efficient usage of the app. I learned that placing function button on almost evey part of the page was very helpful for the users to perform the tasks that they were seeking. Even though some part was quite repetitive, I was able to catch small mistakes or some difficulites that they app might produce. I was able to examine the project in different perspectives and it helped to build a future reference. I was also able to learn how the alignment of the application design played a crucial role in the user accessibility. Creating consistency throughout application seemed to help the user to minimize their time wasted in perfoming a task and maxmized the efficiency. Consecutive steps for performing a task was very important throughout the process. None of the processes were unnecessary and seemed to provide assurance of their process to the users throughout their navigation through the app.
